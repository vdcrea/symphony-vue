HTTP Response Header Mappings
-----------------------------

Allows more control over Frontend page HTTP response headers using
customizable page types. Each mapping is stored in the Symphony config file,
and page type is matched against these mappings.

This extension is based completely on Alistair Kearney's Content Type Mappings
extension.


[INSTALLATION]

1. Enable the extension
2. Add HTTP response header mappings to your /manifest/config.php file with
   the format 'PAGE TYPE' => 'RESPONSE HEADER', e.g.:

		###### HTTP-RESPONSE-HEADER-MAPPINGS ######
		'http-response-header-mappings' => array(
			'503' => 'HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable',
		),
		########

3. If a page uses a type listed in the config, that appropriate HTTP response
   header will be set. Should more than one match be found, the last one
   encountered will be used.
