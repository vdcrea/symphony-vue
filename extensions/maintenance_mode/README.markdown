# Maintenance Mode

Maintenance mode will block all front-end pages from being viewed unless logged in via the administration area. This is particularly useful if you need to edit your site without visitors seeing missing or incomplete pages.

## Installation & Updating

Information about [installing and updating extensions](http://getsymphony.com/learn/tasks/view/install-an-extension/) can be found in the Symphony documentation at <http://getsymphony.com/learn/>.
